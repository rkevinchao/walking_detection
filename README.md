* Purpose:
	* The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create Machine Learning Models from raw accelerometer dataset. I use Walking Detection as an example.
	* The whole process aims to be simple and easy to understand the end-to-end pipeline of Data Science project.    

* Data:
	* The raw accelerometer data was download from: 
		* https://physionet.org/content/accelerometry-walk-climb-drive/1.0.0/
	* The sampling rate of the Acc data is 100 Hz 
	* Data including labeled activities of walking, stair climbing, and driving.
	* Types of activities:
		* 1=walking (Walking) 
		* 2=descending stairs (DescStairs)
		* 3=ascending stairs (AscendStairs)
		* 4=driving (Driving)
		* 77=clapping (Clapping)
		* 99=non-study activity (NonStudyAct)
	* Device positions:
		* lw: left wrist (WristL)
		* rw: right wrist (WristR)
		* lh: left hip (HipL)
		* rg: right hip (HipR)
		* la: left ankle (AnkleL)
		* ra: right ankle (AnkleR)
	* The unit of accelerometer is in g (9.8 m/s^2)
